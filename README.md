Feel free to customize the README file with more detailed instructions, usage examples, or additional sections based on your project's specific needs. Replace placeholders (e.g., <script_name>, <package_name>) with actual names and details relevant to your script.

After creating the README file, save it as README.md in the same directory as your script (webscanner.py). Users will then have clear documentation on how to use and interact with your WebScanner tool. Adjust and expand the content as needed to best communicate the purpose and functionality of your script. If you have any further questions or need additional guidance, please let me know!
